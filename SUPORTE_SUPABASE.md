# Supabase Support Request - Critical PostgreSQL Database Corruption

## Subject: URGENT - Production Database Corruption Causing Complete Service Failure

---

**Dear Supabase Support Team,**

I am writing to report a **critical production database corruption** that is causing complete service failure for our contact form functionality. This issue requires immediate attention and database restoration.

## Problem Description

**Primary Issue:** Our production contact form is returning HTTP 500 errors, preventing users from submitting inquiries through our website.

**Root Cause:** After analyzing the production logs, we have identified **critical PostgreSQL database corruption** in our production environment.

## Technical Evidence from Production Logs

The following critical errors are consistently appearing in our production PostgreSQL logs:

### Database Corruption Indicators:
```
2025-01-18 [timestamp] [ERROR] database system is shut down
2025-01-18 [timestamp] [PANIC] invalid checkpoint record
2025-01-18 [timestamp] [ERROR] startup process (PID xxxx) was terminated by signal 6: Aborted
2025-01-18 [timestamp] [ERROR] aborting startup due to startup process failure
```

### Checkpoint System Failures:
- Multiple "invalid checkpoint record" errors
- Consistent startup process terminations
- Database system showing as "shut down" despite restart attempts
- PostgreSQL unable to complete recovery process

## Business Impact

- **Complete contact form failure** - customers cannot reach us through our primary communication channel
- **Lost business opportunities** - potential clients unable to submit inquiries
- **Reputation damage** - website appears broken to visitors
- **Service disruption** affecting our core business operations

## Technical Environment Details

- **Project ID:** [Your Supabase Project ID]
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase managed)
- **Error Timeline:** Started approximately [date/time when issues began]
- **Affected Services:** Database queries, contact form submissions
- **Error Pattern:** Consistent database corruption errors across all connection attempts

## Previous Troubleshooting Attempts

1. **Local Environment:** Successfully resolved identical corruption in local development using `npx supabase db reset`
2. **Migration Analysis:** Confirmed that missing migrations are NOT the root cause
3. **Log Analysis:** Verified that the issue is database corruption, not application-level problems
4. **Service Monitoring:** Confirmed Auth and Storage services are operational, only Database is affected

## Urgent Request for Support

**We urgently need:**

1. **Immediate Database Restoration** from the most recent clean backup
2. **Root Cause Investigation** to understand how this corruption occurred
3. **Prevention Measures** to avoid future database corruption
4. **Timeline Estimate** for complete service restoration

## Additional Information

We have detailed migration files and documentation ready if needed for the restoration process. Our local development environment has been successfully restored and is functioning properly.

This is a **production-critical issue** affecting our business operations. We would greatly appreciate your immediate attention and fastest possible resolution.
